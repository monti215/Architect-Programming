Mobile Architect &amp; Programming

-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I developed is an inventory tracking app with Android Studio and Java that allows the user to add items into a database. 
Once Items are added to a database, the user can then update that information as well as deleting it.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens designed for this app was a login screen and a database screen that used a grid layout within Android Studio

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approach the process of coding an app by first collecting user requirements and needs, second to start to develop a design, and third to start teh actual development of that design.

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
By constantly running the code after every few lines of writing it helped to ensure that everything was running smoothly.

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I learned that time is your best ally in developing an app. Taking your time and giving yourself ample time goes a long way.
